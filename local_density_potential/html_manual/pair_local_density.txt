[Description:]

The local density (LD) potential is a new potential style that is, in some sense, a generalization of embedded atom models (EAM). 
We call it a local density potential because it assigns an energy to an atom depending on the number of neighboring atoms of given type 
around it within a predefined spherical volume (i.e., within a cutoff). Our work suggests that such potentials can be widely useful 
in capturing effective multibody forces in a computationally efficient manner so as to improve the quality of CG models of implicit solvation"(Sanyal_Shell_1)"_#Sanyal_Shell_1 
and phase-segregation in liquid mixtures"(Sanyal_Shell_2)"_#Sanyal_Shell_2, 
and provide guidelines to determine the extent of manybody correlations present in a CG model."(Rosenberger)"_#Rosenberger 
The LD potential in LAMMPS is primarily intended to be used as a corrective potential over traditional pair potentials in bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models, 
i.e., as a hybrid pair style with other explicit pair interaction terms (e.g., table spline, Lennard Jones, etc.). Because the LD potential is not a pair potential per se, 
we implement it simply as a single auxiliary file with all specifications for the local density potentials that will be read upon initialization.

[Illustration of the potential in a system with a single CG atom type:]

A system of a single atom type (e.g., LJ argon) with a single local density (LD) potential would have an energy that follow

:c,image(Eqs/pair_local_density_energy.jpg)

where rho_i is the LD at atom i and F(rho) is similar in spirit to the embedding function used in EAM potentials. The LD at atom i is given by the sum

:c,image(Eqs/pair_local_density_ld.jpg)


where varphi is an indicator function that is one at r=0 and zero beyond a cutoff distance r_c). The choice of varphi is somewhat arbitrary, 
but the following piecewise cubic function seems sufficiently general in our previous experience:"(Sanyal_Shell_2)"_#Sanyal_Shell_1,"(Sanyal_Shell_1)"_#Sanyal_Shell_2,"(Rosenberger)"_#Rosenberger

:c,image(Eqs/pair_local_density_cubic.jpg)

The constants c are chosen so that the indicator function smoothly interpolates between 1 and 0 between the distances R_1 and R_2, which we call the inner and outer cutoffs. 
Thus varphi satisfies varphi(R_1) = 1, varphi(R_2) = dphi/dr (r=R_1) =  dphi/dr (r=R_2) = 0. 
The embedding function F(rho) may or may not have a closed-form expression. 
To maintain generality, we represent it with a spline-interpolated table over a predetermined range of rho. Outside of that range it simply adopts values at the endpoints.

[Systems with arbitrary numbers of atom types]

The potential is easily generalized to systems involving multiple atom types:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_local_density_energy_multi.jpg)

with

:c,image(Eqs/pair_local_density_ld_multi.jpg)

where alpha gives the type of atom i, beta the type of atom j, and the coefficients a and b filter for atom types as specified by the user. 
We call a the entral atom filter as it determines to which atoms the potential applies; 
a_alpha = 1 if the LD potential applies to atom type alpha else zero. 
On the other hand, we call b the neighbor atom filter because it specifies which atom types to use in the calculation of the LD; 
b_beta = 1 if atom type beta contributes to the LD and zero otherwise.

Note that the potentials need not be symmetric with respect to atom types, which is the reason for two distinct sets of coefficients a and b. 
An atom type may contribute to the LD but not the potential, or to the potential but not the LD. 
Such decisions are made by the user and should (ideally) be motivated on physical grounds for the problem at hand.

It can be shown that the total force between two atoms due to the LD potential takes the form of a pair force, which motivates its designation as a LAMMPS pair style. 
Please see ref. "(Sanyal_Shell_1)"_#Sanyal_Shell_1 for details of the derivation.

[General form for implementation in LAMMPS]

Of course, a system with many atom types may have many different possible LD potentials, each with their own atom type filters, cutoffs, and embedding functions. 
The most general form of this potential as implemented in the \texttt{pair\_style localdensity} is

:c,image(Eqs/pair_local_density_ld_implement.jpg)


where, k is an index that spans the (arbitrary) number of applied LD potentials N_LD. Each LD is calculated as before with:

:c,image(Eqs/pair_local_density_ld_implement_ld.jpg)

The superscript on the indicator function varphi simply indicates that it is associated with specific values of the cutoff distances R_1^(k) and R_2^(k).

To summarize, there may be N_LD distinct LD potentials.  With each potential k, one must specify:


- the inner and outer cutoffs as R_1 and R_2 
- the central type filter a^(k), where k = 1,2,...N_LD
- the neighbor type filter b^(k), where k = 1,2,...N_LD
- the LD potential function F^(k)(rho) , typically as a table that is later spline-interpolated
